Craniofacial Anatomy

00:00:01.928 --> 00:00:07.067
Cranium Bones (8):** The cranium consists of eight bones that protect the brain.

00:00:07.067 --> 00:00:11.403
Notable bones include the frontal bone (forehead) and the occipital bone

00:00:11.403 --> 00:00:15.283
(back of the skull), along with the parietal and temporal bones.

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:22.040
Facial Bones (14):** The facial skeleton includes fourteen bones that shape the face and support the oral cavity.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.168
Key bones are the maxilla (upper jaw), mandible (lower jaw), zygomatic

00:00:27.168 --> 00:00:31.979
(cheekbones), nasal bones (bridge of the nose), and palatine bones (hard

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:33.055
palate).

00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:36.228
Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ):

00:00:36.228 --> 00:00:44.423
Functions:** This joint connects the mandible to the skull, enabling essential jaw movements for chewing, speaking, and facial gestures.

00:00:44.423 --> 00:00:51.574
Disorders (TMDs):** Temporomandibular disorders can occur due to stress, arthritis, or bite misalignment.

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:55.851
Symptoms often include jaw pain, headaches, and clicking sounds.

00:00:55.851 --> 00:01:00.685
Treatment may involve physical therapy, dental care, and stress relief strategies.
