00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.855
Organs and Systems Relevant to Dentistry

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:04.515
Skeletal System:

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:09.934
The skeletal system provides structure and protection, particularly supporting dental implants.

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:15.230
The maxilla and mandible are crucial for the stability and success of various dental procedures.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.017
Muscular System:

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:21.529
The muscular system facilitates jaw movements essential for chewing and speaking.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:29.191
Key muscles, like the masseter and temporalis, allow for efficient food breaking and digestion, which is important for dental health.

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:31.305
Cardiovascular System:

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:36.887
The cardiovascular system delivers oxygen and nutrients critical for healing after dental procedures.

00:00:36.887 --> 00:00:44.638
Dentists must consider patients' cardiovascular health, especially for those with heart conditions, as it may impact treatment and recovery.

00:00:44.638 --> 00:00:47.097
Lymphatic/Immune System:

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:52.684
The lymphatic and immune systems defend against oral infections, such as periodontal disease.

00:00:52.684 --> 00:00:58.811
A strong immune response is essential for preventing complications and ensuring better outcomes in dental care.

00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:05.599
These systems highlight the importance of a holistic approach to dentistry, as oral health connects closely to overall well-being.
