00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.018
History of Dental Assisting

00:00:02.018 --> 00:00:09.724
Early 1900s**: 
Dental practices relied on informal support roles, often filled by office secretaries or family members without formal training.

00:00:10.624 --> 00:00:12.185
1920s - 1930s**:

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:17.124
A significant shift occurred when Dr. Alfred C. Fones trained Irene Newman as

00:00:17.124 --> 00:00:22.186
the first dental hygienist, paving the way for specialized roles and structured training.

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:26.398
1940s (WWII)**: 
World War II created high demand for dental assistants

00:00:26.398 --> 00:00:30.117
due to a shortage of practicing dentists, expanding their roles significantly.

00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:33.460
1950s - 1960s**:

00:00:34.683 --> 00:00:38.233
Formal training programs for dental assistants were established, and the

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:43.480
American Dental Assistants Association (ADAA) gained prominence, advocating for the

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.771
profession.

00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:47.145
1970 - Present**:

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:53.573
The profession gained recognition with certification programs like the Dental Assisting National Board (DANB).

00:00:53.573 --> 00:00:57.680
Dental assistants now perform a variety of clinical and administrative tasks,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.959
reflecting their essential role in patient care and dental practice efficiency.

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:08.571
Overall, dental assisting has evolved from informal roles to a respected profession with professional training and certification.
