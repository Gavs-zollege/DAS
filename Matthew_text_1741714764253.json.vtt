00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.676
Anatomy and Physiology in Dentistry

00:00:02.676 --> 00:00:03.930
Anatomy:

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.504
This field studies the structure of the human body, particularly the oral cavity.

00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:12.993
It focuses on the arrangement and characteristics of teeth, gums, jaws, and

00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:18.213
surrounding tissues, which is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment in dentistry.

00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:19.745
Physiology:

00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:22.968
This aspect examines how bodily systems function.

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:27.605
In dentistry, it involves understanding processes such as tooth development, the role of

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:32.666
saliva in oral health, and the biological responses of gum tissues to treatments.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.754
Applications in Dentistry:

00:00:34.754 --> 00:00:37.021
Understanding Oral Structures:

00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:41.229
Dentists need to know the different types of teeth (incisors, canines,

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:45.950
premolars, molars) and surrounding tissues to perform routine check-ups or complex

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.315
procedures.

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:49.030
Directional Terms:

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.534
Precise terminology like mesial (toward the midline) and distal (away from

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:57.270
the midline) is crucial for clear communication and documentation in dental

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.479
practice.

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.097
Body Planes:

00:01:00.097 --> 00:01:04.121
These anatomical planes help locate and describe oral features.

00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:05.950
Midsagittal Plane:

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.004
This divides the body into equal right and left halves, allowing assessment of symmetry in the oral cavity.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:13.543
Frontal Plane:

00:01:13.543 --> 00:01:17.032
Also known as the coronal plane, it separates the body into front

00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:20.748
and back sections, aiding in understanding the layout of facial structures and

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:21.821
teeth.

00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:25.931
Integrating knowledge of anatomy and physiology enhances a dental professional's ability

00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:30.270
to understand patient needs, plan effective treatments, and communicate about oral

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.270
health.
