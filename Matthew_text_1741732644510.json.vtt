00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.623
Tissues of the Tooth

00:00:01.623 --> 00:00:02.735
Enamel:

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:05.744
Enamel is the hardest tissue in the human body, covering the

00:00:05.744 --> 00:00:09.955
tooth's surface and protecting the underlying dentin from damage and bacteria.

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:15.430
Its tightly packed, highly calcified prisms provide strength against chewing and acidity.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.565
Dentin:

00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:20.554
Dentin makes up the bulk of the tooth, situated beneath the enamel.

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:26.654
It contains dentinal tubules that transmit sensations to the pulp and can regenerate to repair minor damage.

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:27.684
Pulp:

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:33.527
The pulp is the soft tissue at the tooth's center, rich in blood vessels, nerves, and connective tissue.

00:00:33.527 --> 00:00:37.030
It nourishes the tooth and allows for sensory functions, divided into

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.277
coronal pulp (in the crown) and radicular pulp (in the root).

00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:42.641
Cementum:

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:48.601
Cementum is a calcified tissue covering the tooth's root, connecting with enamel at the cementoenamel junction.

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:55.004
It anchors periodontal fibers that stabilize the tooth in the jaw and can regenerate to assist in recovery from injuries.
