00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.144
anatomic parts of the tooth

00:00:02.144 --> 00:00:03.317
Crown:

00:00:03.317 --> 00:00:05.996
Anatomic Crown:** This is the portion of the tooth that

00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:08.940
is covered by enamel, which is the hard, protective outer

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.789
layer.

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.821
The anatomic crown remains unchanged throughout a person's life, regardless

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:16.071
of any gum recession or other dental issues that may

00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:17.140
occur.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.793
Clinical Crown:** The clinical crown refers to the portion of the tooth that is visible above the gum line.

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:27.638
Unlike the anatomic crown, the clinical crown can fluctuate in size as the gums recede due

00:00:27.638 --> 00:00:33.743
to factors such as periodontal disease or aging, thereby exposing more of the tooth structure beneath.

00:00:33.743 --> 00:00:34.676
Root:

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:36.524
The root of the tooth is the part that is anchored

00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:41.706
within the jawbone, specifically within the alveolar bone, which provides support.

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:47.685
The root is covered by a layer of cementum, a calcified tissue that helps secure the tooth within its socket.

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:52.594
Teeth can possess a varying number of roots: some may have just one root (single-rooted),

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:59.458
while others can exhibit two roots (bifurcation) or three roots (trifurcation), typically seen in molars.

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:05.297
The number and configuration of roots can influence the tooth's stability and the complexity of dental procedures.

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:06.539
Cervix:

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.720
The cervix, often referred to as the neck of the tooth, is

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.907
the narrow region where the crown of the tooth meets the root.

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:18.045
This area is clinically significant as it marks the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), where

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:21.725
the enamel of the crown ends, and the cementum of the root begins.

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:24.066
The CEJ is important in dentistry as it is often the

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:28.510
site of various dental issues, such as caries or periodontal disease.
