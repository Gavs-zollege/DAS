00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.653
Cellular Foundations in Oral Health

00:00:02.653 --> 00:00:08.779
Cells**: Cells are the basic building blocks of the body, with about 75 trillion present in adults.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:13.267
Each cell plays a vital role in maintaining health, including oral health.

00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:14.783
Key Structures**:

00:00:14.783 --> 00:00:18.868
Cell Membrane**: This protective barrier regulates the movement of substances in

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:22.934
and out of the cell, ensuring nutrient intake and waste removal.

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:31.707
Cytoplasm**: A gel-like substance surrounding organelles, the cytoplasm facilitates essential biochemical reactions needed for cell function.

00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:36.539
Nucleus**: The cell's command center, the nucleus contains DNA and RNA.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:42.769
DNA holds genetic instructions, while RNA is involved in protein synthesis and gene regulation.

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.016
Relevance**:

00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:50.811
Stem Cells**: These undifferentiated cells can develop into various cell types and have significant potential in oral health.

00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:55.997
They may regenerate damaged dental tissues, especially in cases of periodontal disease, leading

00:00:55.997 --> 00:01:00.752
to innovative treatment options that focus on restoration rather than mere symptom management.
