Periodontium and Oral Health

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:07.283
The periodontium is a crucial structure that supports and maintains the health of our teeth.

00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:12.063
It consists of various components, each playing an essential role in oral health.

00:00:12.063 --> 00:00:13.398
Components:

00:00:13.398 --> 00:00:16.758
Cementum:** This hard tissue covers the root of each tooth.

00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:21.864
It helps anchor the tooth in place by providing a surface for the periodontal ligaments to attach.

00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:27.613
Cementum plays a vital role in tooth stability and is essential for tooth repair following minor injuries.

00:00:27.613 --> 00:00:33.500
Periodontal Ligaments:** These fibrous tissues are responsible for anchoring the teeth to the alveolar bone.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.831
They absorb the forces exerted during chewing and provide necessary cushioning, helping

00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:41.760
to prevent damage to both the teeth and the surrounding bone structure.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.310
Alveolar Bone:** This portion of the jawbone forms the socket that holds the teeth.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.412
Alveolar bone not only supports the teeth but also undergoes continual remodeling

00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:53.101
in response to the stresses placed on it through chewing and other

00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:54.406
activities.

00:00:54.406 --> 00:00:55.707
Functions:

00:00:55.707 --> 00:01:02.327
Provides Stability:** Together, the cementum, periodontal ligaments, and alveolar bone form a strong foundation

00:01:02.327 --> 00:01:06.500
that keeps teeth securely in place while allowing for slight movements necessary for normal

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.762
function.

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:15.280
Protects Teeth from Stress:** The periodontal ligaments absorb and dissipate the forces generated during activities such as chewing and biting.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.174
This protective mechanism helps to prevent damage to the teeth and surrounding structures.

00:01:20.174 --> 00:01:26.983
Detects Pressure During Chewing:** The periodontal ligaments contain specialized nerve endings that sense pressure and tension.

00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:30.606
This sensory function allows for the awareness of biting force, helping

00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:33.084
to prevent excessive pressure that could lead to tooth or jaw

00:01:33.084 --> 00:01:34.084
injury.
