00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.189
Anatomic Features of Teeth


00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:03.585
Contours:


00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:09.553
The contours of teeth, including both the facial (the side facing the lips and cheeks) and lingual


00:00:09.553 --> 00:00:15.224
(the side facing the tongue) surfaces, play a crucial role in the functionality of the oral cavity.


00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:19.059
These contours are designed to efficiently direct food into the mouth during chewing


00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:23.579
while also serving to protect the surrounding gum tissue from injury or irritation.


00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:24.901
Contacts:


00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:29.396
Contacts refer to the areas where adjacent teeth come into contact with one another.


00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:34.778
These points of contact are vital for maintaining proper dental alignment and preventing food particles from becoming


00:00:34.778 --> 00:00:40.599
lodged between teeth, which can lead to discomfort and dental issues such as cavities and gum disease.


00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:42.032
Embrasures:


00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:47.390
Embrasures are the V-shaped spaces located between the teeth, formed by the contact points.


00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.125
These triangular gaps not only contribute to the overall aesthetic appearance of


00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.807
the smile but also allow for the proper flow of food during


00:00:53.807 --> 00:00:54.705
chewing.


00:00:54.705 --> 00:01:00.633
They facilitate effective cleaning and help maintain oral hygiene by enabling the displacement of food debris.


00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:01.871
Occlusion:


00:01:01.871 --> 00:01:04.142
Occlusion is the term used to describe the way the


00:01:04.142 --> 00:01:06.197
upper and lower teeth fit together when the mouth is


00:01:06.197 --> 00:01:07.065
closed.


00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:13.832
Proper occlusion is essential for effective biting and chewing, as it allows for optimal force distribution across the jaw.


00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:21.897
Additionally, a well-aligned occlusion supports jaw health and can help prevent complications such as temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ).
