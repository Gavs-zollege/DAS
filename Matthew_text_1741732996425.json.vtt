00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.676
Periodontium

00:00:01.676 --> 00:00:02.977
Functions:

00:00:02.977 --> 00:00:03.961
1.

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:11.260
Support and Protection:** The periodontium provides essential structural support for teeth, ensuring their stability within the jaw.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.246
It protects the roots and surrounding structures from external forces and potential damage.

00:00:16.246 --> 00:00:17.016
2.

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:22.810
Force Absorption:** During activities such as chewing, the periodontium absorbs and distributes the forces

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.935
exerted on the teeth, minimizing the impact on the dental structures and preventing injury.

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:29.269
Components:

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:30.253
1.

00:00:30.253 --> 00:00:36.676
Cementum:** This calcified tissue covers the roots of the teeth, playing a crucial role in anchoring them within the jaw.

00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:41.352
It helps to attach the periodontal ligament and aids in protecting the root surface.

00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:42.122
2.

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:46.732
Alveolar Bone:** The alveolar bone is the part of the jaw that holds the tooth sockets.

00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:50.667
It provides support for the teeth, ensuring they remain anchored in place.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.259
It also plays a role in dental health, as the bone

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:57.012
can remodel in response to the forces exerted by the teeth.

00:00:57.012 --> 00:00:57.963
3.

00:00:57.963 --> 00:01:04.987
Periodontal Ligament (PDL):** This connective tissue surrounds the roots of the teeth and connects them to the alveolar bone.

00:01:04.987 --> 00:01:09.139
The periodontal ligament not only provides stability and support but also contains

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:13.030
nerve endings that contribute to the sensory perception of pressure and pain.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.320
Its role is vital in maintaining the health of the periodontium and the overall function of the teeth.
