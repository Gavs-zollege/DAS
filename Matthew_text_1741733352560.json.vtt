00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.461
Types of Teeth

00:00:01.461 --> 00:00:02.865
Incisors

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:08.207
Characteristics:** Incisors are the front teeth, typically four on the top and four on the bottom.

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:11.265
They have sharp, thin edges that are ideal for cutting.

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:14.289
Their flat surface helps in slicing through food.

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:21.038
Function:** The primary role of incisors is to cut food into manageable pieces, making it easier to chew and swallow.

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:24.811
They are often used for biting into crunchy foods like apples.

00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:26.157
Canines

00:00:26.157 --> 00:00:33.100
Characteristics:** Canines are located next to the incisors and are pointed with long, strong roots that anchor them in place.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.407
There are two canines in the upper jaw and two in the lower jaw.

00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:39.594
Their shape allows them to exert considerable pressure.

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:44.148
Function:** The main function of canines is to tear food, especially meat.

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:50.596
Their pointed design makes them effective for gripping and ripping, which is particularly useful for carnivorous diets.

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:51.987
Premolars

00:00:51.987 --> 00:00:57.803
Characteristics:** Premolars, also known as bicuspids, are situated behind the canines.

00:00:57.803 --> 00:01:02.963
They have a broader surface with two or more cusps (points) that aid in processing food.

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:07.934
Typically, there are two premolars on each side of the mouth, both upper and lower.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:13.166
Function:** The function of premolars includes grasping, tearing, and chewing food.

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:19.146
They play a crucial role in breaking down food into smaller particles, facilitating further digestion.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:20.310
Molars

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.101
Characteristics:** Molars are larger, flatter teeth located at the back of the mouth,

00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:28.905
with a wide crown and multiple cusps that provide a large surface area.

00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:35.412
Usually, there are three molars on each side of the upper and lower jaws, including wisdom teeth for some individuals.

00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:39.262
Function:** Molars are designed primarily for grinding food.

00:01:39.262 --> 00:01:42.827
Their strong structure allows them to crush and grind tough and fibrous food

00:01:42.827 --> 00:01:47.417
items, such as grains and vegetables, into smaller pieces suitable for swallowing and

00:01:47.417 --> 00:01:48.417
digestion.
