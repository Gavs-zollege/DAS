00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.099
Dental Arches and Divisions


00:00:02.099 --> 00:00:03.639
Dental Arches:


00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.422
Maxillary Arch:** This refers to the upper jaw, which is fixed in place and supports the upper teeth.


00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:16.080
It plays a crucial role in the alignment and function of the dental structures, occlusion, and overall facial symmetry.


00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.244
Mandibular Arch:** This is the lower jaw that is movable,


00:00:19.244 --> 00:00:23.061
allowing for various functions such as chewing, speaking, and facial


00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:24.226
expressions.


00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:30.400
The mobility of the mandibular arch is essential for proper articulation of sounds and efficient mastication of food.


00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.364
Quadrants and Sextants:


00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:37.474
Quadrants:** The dental arches can be divided into four quadrants, which include:


00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:38.458
1.


00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:40.559
Maxillary Right Quadrant


00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.329
2.


00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.436
Maxillary Left Quadrant


00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:44.387
3.


00:00:44.387 --> 00:00:46.379
Mandibular Right Quadrant


00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.374
4.


00:00:47.374 --> 00:00:49.378
Mandibular Left Quadrant


00:00:49.378 --> 00:00:56.942
Each quadrant contains a specific set of teeth, typically including incisors, canines, premolars, and molars.


00:00:56.942 --> 00:01:03.023
Sextants:** For a more detailed subdivision, the dental arches are also divided into six sextants.


00:01:03.023 --> 00:01:05.369
This division typically includes:


00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.353
1.


00:01:06.353 --> 00:01:09.194
Anterior Maxillary Sextant (front upper teeth


00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:10.107
2.


00:01:10.107 --> 00:01:13.100
Posterior Maxillary Sextant (back upper teeth


00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.151
3.


00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:17.105
Anterior Mandibular Sextant (front lower teeth


00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:18.158
4.


00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:21.681
Posterior Mandibular Sextant (back lower teeth
