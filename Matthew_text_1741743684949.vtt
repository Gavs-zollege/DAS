00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.893
Tooth Numbering Systems


00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:04.032
Universal National System:


00:00:04.032 --> 00:00:08.888
In the Universal National System, permanent teeth are assigned a numerical designation from 1


00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:12.597
to 32, starting with tooth number 1 for the upper right third molar and


00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:16.669
progressing sequentially around the mouth to tooth number 16 for the upper left third


00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:17.493
molar.


00:00:17.493 --> 00:00:23.058
For primary (deciduous) teeth, the system uses uppercase letters ranging from A to T,


00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:26.916
with tooth A representing the upper right second molar and continuing around the dental


00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:27.955
arch.


00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:30.959
FDI (International) System:


00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:36.987
The FDI (Fédération Dentaire Internationale) System employs a two-digit numbering format


00:00:36.987 --> 00:00:40.189
that specifies the tooth's quadrant and its specific position within that


00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:41.128
quadrant.


00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:44.798
The first digit indicates the quadrant: 1 for the upper right, 2 for


00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:48.355
the upper left, 3 for the lower left, and 4 for the lower


00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:49.178
right.


00:00:49.178 --> 00:00:53.877
The second digit specifies the tooth type, with numbers from 1 to 8 representing the sequence of


00:00:53.877 --> 00:01:00.647
teeth, such as 11 for the maxillary right central incisor and 26 for the mandibular left canine.


00:01:00.647 --> 00:01:02.313
Palmer Notation:


00:01:02.313 --> 00:01:08.555
The Palmer Notation system uses brackets to indicate the quadrants of the dental arch, making it visually intuitive.


00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:11.860
Each quadrant is represented by a distinct bracket, and within each


00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.963
quadrant, teeth are numbered or designated by letters based on their


00:01:14.963 --> 00:01:15.953
position.


00:01:15.953 --> 00:01:22.868
For example, the central incisor in each quadrant is designated as '1,' while the first molar is denoted as '6.


00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:28.651
This system is especially useful in orthodontics and for case documentation due to its clarity and compactness.
