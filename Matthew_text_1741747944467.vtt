00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.971
positioning the dental team


00:00:01.971 --> 00:00:03.971
Dentist (Operator):


00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:06.623
Ensure your back remains straight by sitting upright in your


00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:08.990
chair, with your feet flat on the floor to provide


00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.989
stability.


00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:14.524
Position your elbows close to your body to maintain a comfortable and controlled posture.


00:00:14.524 --> 00:00:17.678
Additionally, adjust the patient's oral cavity so that it is at the


00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:21.830
same level as your elbows for optimal accessibility and ease of work.


00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.357
Dental Assistant:


00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:27.979
As a dental assistant, your seating position should be about 4-5 inches higher than that of the dentist.


00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.761
This elevation allows you to comfortably assist while maintaining an effective line of sight.


00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:39.798
Keep your back straight to promote good posture; your feet should rest firmly on a foot platform to provide support.


00:00:39.798 --> 00:00:46.563
Make sure your body is oriented towards the patientâ€™s head to facilitate effective communication and assistance during procedures.


00:00:46.563 --> 00:00:47.964
Ergonomics:


00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:53.538
Adopting proper ergonomic practices is essential in dentistry to prevent common work-related injuries.


00:00:53.538 --> 00:00:59.280
Effective ergonomics can significantly reduce the risk of developing conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome, which


00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.113
affects hand and wrist function, as well as neck and back pain resulting from poor


00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:04.120
posture.


00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.172
By focusing on these principles, dental professionals can minimize the occurrence


00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:12.100
of cumulative trauma disorders, ensuring a healthier and more sustainable work


00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.100
environment.
