00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.268
Instrument transfer techniques


00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:03.985
Basic Principles:


00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:10.401
Minimize Movement:** When handling instruments, strive for minimal motion in your fingers, wrist, and elbow.


00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:15.047
This not only conserves energy but also enhances precision during procedures.


00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:18.933
Proper Positioning:** Ensure that instruments are positioned for easy access


00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.919
during use, with the working end oriented correctly towards the


00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:22.882
dentist.


00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:28.060
This facilitates smooth transitions between tasks and enhances workflow efficiency.


00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:35.292
Secure Grip Confirmation:** Before releasing any instrument into the dentist’s hand, verify that they have a firm and secure grasp.


00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:39.150
This avoids any potential mishaps that could disrupt the procedure.


00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.091
Single-Handed Technique:


00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:47.221
Instrument Retrieval:** Utilize your thumb, index, and middle fingers to deftly retrieve instruments.


00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:52.992
This method allows for a quick and efficient hand-off while maintaining control over the instrument’s placement.


00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:58.937
Handling Used Instruments:** When dealing with used instruments, employ your ring and little fingers to pick them up.


00:00:58.937 --> 00:01:04.886
This technique frees your thumb, index, and middle fingers to prepare the next instrument for delivery.


00:01:04.886 --> 00:01:11.074
Instrument Delivery:** Once you have retrieved a new instrument, place it firmly and confidently into the dentist's grip.


00:01:11.074 --> 00:01:15.989
Ensuring a stable transfer supports uninterrupted workflow during dental procedures.


00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:17.751
Two-Handed Technique:


00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:23.079
Retrieving Used Instruments:** Use your right hand to deftly retrieve the used instrument from the dentist.


00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.422
This ensures you are not interrupting their focus while they work.


00:01:26.422 --> 00:01:32.257
Delivering New Instruments:** With the left hand, simultaneously deliver the new instrument to the dentist.


00:01:32.257 --> 00:01:38.384
This collaborative approach improves efficiency, allowing the dentist to maintain their flow and focus during the procedure.
