The Evolution of dentistry

00:00:02.072 --> 00:00:07.184
Dentistry has evolved significantly over the centuries, from ancient times to the present day.

00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:14.753
Ancient civilizations practiced basic dentistry, which included procedures like extractions and the use of herbs for pain relief.

00:00:14.753 --> 00:00:18.983
The 18th and 19th centuries marked the establishment of the first dental schools, the

00:00:18.983 --> 00:00:23.730
introduction of anesthesia, and the invention of the dental chair, which greatly improved patient

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.901
comfort.

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:30.935
The 20th century brought about the development of fluoride, significantly reducing the prevalence of cavities.

00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:37.032
Today, modern dentistry employs advanced technologies such as digital imaging and CAD/CAM systems for enhanced precision.

00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:47.083
Additional innovations include digital X-rays, 3D printing, and same-day crowns, all contributing to more effective and efficient dental care.
