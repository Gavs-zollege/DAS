00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.810
dentition periods


00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.852
Primary (Deciduous) Dentition:


00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:10.173
The primary dentition consists of a total of 20 teeth that usually begin to erupt by the age of 2.


00:00:10.173 --> 00:00:16.272
This set includes four central incisors, four lateral incisors, two canines, and eight molars,


00:00:16.272 --> 00:00:22.102
which play a crucial role in early childhood development, including biting, chewing, and speech.


00:00:22.102 --> 00:00:23.696
Mixed Dentition:


00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:26.907
The mixed dentition phase occurs typically between the ages of 6 and


00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:31.832
12, during which children experience the transition from primary to permanent teeth.


00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:39.148
This stage involves a combination of both primary teeth, which are gradually lost, and permanent teeth, which are steadily emerging.


00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:43.735
This transitional period is essential for proper alignment and development of the jaw.


00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:45.452
Permanent Dentition:


00:00:45.452 --> 00:00:51.269
The permanent dentition consists of a total of 32 teeth that usually begin to erupt after the age of 12.


00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:59.352
This set is more complex and includes eight incisors, four canines, eight premolars, and twelve molars (including the wisdom teeth).


00:00:59.352 --> 00:01:03.083
These teeth are designed for a lifetime of use, contributing not only to


00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:07.471
effective chewing and eating but also to overall oral health and facial aesthetics.


00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:13.459
Proper care is essential at this stage to maintain dental health and prevent issues such as cavities and gum disease.
