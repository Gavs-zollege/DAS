Types of Tissues:

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.450
Epithelial Tissue: Protects surfaces, including the lining of the mouth, and facilitates absorption and sensation.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.906
Connective Tissue: Provides structural support for teeth and gums, anchoring teeth and nourishing surrounding tissues.

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:21.852
Muscle Tissue: Enables movement for chewing and speaking through coordinated contractions.

00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:27.880
Nervous Tissue: Transmits sensory signals from the mouth, allowing us to experience taste and temperature.
