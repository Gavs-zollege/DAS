Occlusion and Malocclusion

00:00:02.074 --> 00:00:06.818
Occlusion** refers to the optimal alignment of the upper and lower teeth when the jaws are closed.

00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:13.488
This ideal alignment ensures proper function during biting and chewing, as well as contributes to overall oral health.

00:00:13.488 --> 00:00:18.730
Malocclusion**, on the other hand, is the term used to describe any misalignment of the teeth.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.838
It can lead to functional issues, discomfort, and aesthetic concerns.

00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:26.391
Malocclusion is classified into three main categories:

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:31.288
Class I:** This classification is characterized by normal dental alignment, but there

00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:34.128
may be minor issues such as slight spacing or crowding of the

00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:34.928
teeth.

00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:40.494
Individuals with Class I malocclusion typically do not experience significant functional problems.

00:00:40.494 --> 00:00:47.201
Class II:** Often referred to as an overbite, this class occurs when the upper teeth significantly overlap the lower teeth.

00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:50.352
This can result in a protruding appearance of the upper front teeth and may

00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:54.079
lead to wear on the teeth, jaw pain, or other dental issues if left

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.332
untreated.

00:00:55.332 --> 00:01:01.688
Class III:** Known as an underbite, Class III malocclusion occurs when the lower teeth protrude beyond the upper teeth.

00:01:01.688 --> 00:01:08.260
This misalignment can impact the bite and chewing efficiency, often causing discomfort and influencing facial aesthetics.
