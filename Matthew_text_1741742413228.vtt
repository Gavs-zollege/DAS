00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.597
Tooth Surfaces


00:00:01.597 --> 00:00:03.157
Facial Surface**:


00:00:03.157 --> 00:00:06.991
This is the outermost surface of the tooth that is oriented towards the face.


00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:11.211
It is divided into two parts: the **labial surface**, which is the part closest


00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:15.776
to the lips, and the **buccal surface**, which is situated adjacent to the cheeks.


00:00:15.776 --> 00:00:19.126
This surface is important for both aesthetics and function, as it is


00:00:19.126 --> 00:00:22.498
the part of the tooth that is visible when a person smiles.


00:00:22.498 --> 00:00:24.025
Lingual Surface**:


00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:28.152
The lingual surface refers to the inner surface of the teeth that faces the tongue.


00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:31.178
It plays a crucial role in speech and swallowing, as well as


00:00:31.178 --> 00:00:35.157
in maintaining proper oral hygiene, since it can accumulate plaque and food


00:00:35.157 --> 00:00:36.308
debris.


00:00:36.308 --> 00:00:38.293
Masticatory Surface**:


00:00:38.293 --> 00:00:43.267
This is the surface of the tooth that comes into contact with opposing teeth during biting and chewing.


00:00:43.267 --> 00:00:47.504
For the anterior teeth (incisors and canines), this surface is known as


00:00:47.504 --> 00:00:51.546
the **incisal surface**, which has a sharp edge to effectively cut food.


00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:55.628
For the posterior teeth (premolars and molars), the surface is called the


00:00:55.628 --> 00:00:59.471
**occlusal surface**, which is flat and broad, designed to crush and grind


00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:00.570
food.


00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.237
Mesial Surface**:


00:01:02.237 --> 00:01:05.657
The mesial surface is the side of the tooth that is closest to the midline of the


00:01:05.657 --> 00:01:10.470
dental arch, which is an imaginary line that divides the left and right sides of the mouth.


00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.524
This surface is significant for proper tooth alignment and spacing, contributing to overall dental health.


00:01:16.524 --> 00:01:18.108
Distal Surface**:


00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:23.354
Conversely, the distal surface is the side of the tooth that is farthest from the midline of the mouth.


00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:27.122
This surface can often be more difficult to clean, making it important to


00:01:27.122 --> 00:01:31.641
pay attention to during oral hygiene practices to prevent decay and gum disease.
