00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.121
Oral Features and Dentition

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:03.572
Oral Cavity:

00:00:03.572 --> 00:00:09.053
Vestibule:** The space between the lips/cheeks and teeth is essential for food movement and speech.

00:00:09.053 --> 00:00:15.661
Oral Cavity Proper:** This main area within the dental arches houses the tongue and is critical for digestion and communication.

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:17.594
Gingiva (Gums):

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:22.862
Composed of attached and interdental gingiva, the attached gingiva firmly stabilizes teeth by binding

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:27.844
to the bone, while interdental gingiva effectively protects spaces between teeth and enhances oral

00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:29.128
hygiene.

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.371
Types of Teeth and Their Functions:

00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:38.472
Incisors:** These are the forefront teeth designed specifically for cutting food (4 on top, 4 on the bottom).

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:45.996
Canines:** Positioned next to the incisors, these pointed teeth excel at tearing food (2 on top, 2 on bottom).

00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:51.607
Premolars and Molars:** Located at the back, premolars are powerful for crushing and grinding (2 on

00:00:51.607 --> 00:00:57.836
each side), while molars are larger and designed for thorough grinding, typically numbering 12, including wisdom

00:00:57.836 --> 00:00:58.905
teeth.

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:00.716
Dentition Periods:

00:01:00.716 --> 00:01:04.675
Primary Dentition:** This stage features 20 baby teeth that emerge around

00:01:04.675 --> 00:01:08.721
six months, playing a crucial role in eating and speech development.

00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:17.003
Mixed Dentition:** From ages 6 to 12, both primary and permanent teeth coexist, a vital phase for ensuring proper alignment.

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:22.953
Permanent Dentition:** By early adulthood, individuals will possess a full set of 32 permanent teeth,

00:01:22.953 --> 00:01:28.289
engineered for lifelong use in biting and chewing, thus maintaining oral function and jaw structure.
